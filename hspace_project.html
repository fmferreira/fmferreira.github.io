          <h2>Summary of the context and overall objectives of the project</h2>
          <p>Our information society relies to an unprecedented extent on
            broadband communication solutions such as high-speed Internet
            access, mobile voice and data services, multimedia broadcast
            systems, etc. To fulfil the steadily growing volume and bandwidth
            demand of those data services while simultaneously reducing the cost
            per transported information bit, communication systems have been
            continuously improved in terms of reach and aggregate transport
            capacity. However, it is now recognised that communication systems
            are rapidly approaching the fundamental information capacity of
            current technology, a trend with potential negative impact on the
            economy and social progress. </p>
          <p>HSPACE project targeted the development of advanced
            spatial-division-multiplexed (SDM) systems to unlock the capacity of
            future information systems by enabling the transmission of spatial
            super-channels over a single fibre. The proposed concept was
            implemented mainly using and few-mode fibres (FMFs) as underlying
            technology platform along with novel digital signal processing (DSP)
            techniques that minimise the mode interference and inter mode
            nonlinearities, keeping the required digital processing at
            realizable levels. </p>
          <p>The other main objective of the project included multidisciplinary
            scientific training in optical communications, photonic device
            technologies, advanced modelling methods and DSP techniques enabling
            Dr. Filipe Ferreira to become a research leader in this challenging
            area of enormous practical relevance. Additionally, the project
            allowed the development of the Fellow soft-skills such as foreground
            intellectual property (IP) protection, communication skills,
            management skills ensuring that he is equipped to be a future leader
            in industry, or academia. On the other hand, the AIPT benefited from
            the Fellow strong theoretical background on modelling and design of
            FMFs as well as on the simulation of SDM transmission.</p>
          <h2>Work performed from the beginning of the project to the end of the
            period</h2>
          <p>Dr. Ferreira received during the project training from Prof. Andrew
            Ellis, and other colleagues at Aston addressing various topics, such
            as: project management, IP, technical writing, open access and
            research data management, as well as career and personal development
            planning. He successfully completed Introduction to Learning and
            Teaching Practises (ILTP) course and Postgraduate Certificate in
            Learning &amp;Teaching in Higher Education (PGCert). The Fellow’s
            training needs were addressed through a personal Career Development
            Plan aimed at diversifying and complementing his research skills and
            knowledge, providing him with a range of special technical training
            in the area of optical communications, photonic device technologies,
            advanced modelling methods and DSP techniques. During HSPACE, the
            Fellow has extensively developed his communication, teamwork,
            networking and initiative skills as described in the following:</p>

          <h2>Progress beyond the state of the art</h2>
          <p>Dr. Ferreira major achievements during HSPACE were in the area of
            Nonlinear Compensation Methods, Nonlinear Capacity of Few-Mode Fibre
            Links, Designing of Few-Mode Fibre Links and
            Spatial-Mode-Shift-Keying, as I detail below:</p>
          <ol type="A">
            <b>Nonlinear Compensation Methods</b>
            <li> Pioneered a novel in-line NLC method based on all-optical
              optical coherent superposition that takes no additional bandwidth
              of the network elements (fully backward compatibility), and limits
              PMD accumulation to one span (~80km). This method can deliver
              multiple 3dB SNR boosts by exploiting the network’s dark-fibre. A
              novel double-stage interferometer enables the coherent
              superposition. Dr. Ferreira is the lead inventor on the
              twin-fibres GB patent application (no. 1605120.3). The patent
              includes an experimental demonstration of a twin-fibres link with
              20km using a 10Gbps XFP transceiver designed and implemented by
              me, a 2.3dB SNR boost was obtained. </li>
            <li> Extended the digital back-propagation (DBP) method to
              mode-multiplexed systems. A DBP implementation based on Manakov
              equations provides significant gain for a linear mode coupling
              higher than 20dB/100m and for a differential mode delay equal or
              lower than 0.01ps/km, which is not a likely scenario. Thus, DBP
              for few-mode fibres requires mode coupling tracking like SMF
              systems impacted by PMD. (F. Ferreira, et al., ECOC 2017, p.
              W.1.D.3).
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <b>Nonlinear Capacity of Few-Mode Fibre Links</b> </li>
            <li> First to estimate the coupling strength required for the
              suppression of nonlinear distortion in few-mode fibres below that
              of an isolated mode propagating without intermodal nonlinear
              distortion or intermodal coupling. A linear mode coupling above
              20dB/100m is required (F. Ferreira, et al., OFC 2016, p. Tu2E.3),
              which is possible in practice following the appropriate fibre
              design rules, as derived in F. Ferreira, et al., IEEE/OSA JLT,
              vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 353–360, 2014.
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <b>Designing of Few-Mode Fibre Links</b> </li>
            <li> First to identify the analytical relation between the group
              delay spread in few-mode fibres with the real-world fibres
              operating in the intermediate regime, this is operating neither in
              the weak nor the strong coupling regime. The knowledge of group
              delay spread is critical to dimension the receiver memory and
              transmission reach, and to estimate the nonlinear limited
              capacity.
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <b>Spatial-Mode-Shift-Keying</b> </li>
            <li> Development of a proof-of-concept experiment to generate
              spatial-mode-shift-keying signals using one single
              highly-efficient all-dielectric metasurface that has the unique
              ability of simultaneous converting different input polarizations
              of an incoming LP01 signal into different orthogonal LP modes. The
              patent includes an experimental demonstration of a conventional
              polarization multiplexed (or shift-keyed) signal being converted
              into a mode multiplexed (or shift-keyed) signal (LP21 and LP11)
              and back into polarization multiplexed signal, a 100G DP-QPSK
              transponder was used. The experiment was designed and executed by
              me starting from a non-connectorised metasurface sample which
              required a strict free-space arrangement. </li>
